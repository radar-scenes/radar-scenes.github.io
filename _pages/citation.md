The preferred way of citation is to directly cite the data set with its [DOI](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4559821):

{% raw %}

                  Tilly, Julius and
                  Dickmann, Jürgen and
                  Wöhler, Christian},
  title        = {{RadarScenes: A Real-World Radar Point Cloud Data
